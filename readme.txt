This report includes an open-source IP repository specifically for machine learning applications, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), long-term memory neural networks (LRCN), etc. 
Each IP is provided with: introduction, interface description, 
inputs and outputs description, parameter configuration, 
resource and performance, as well as a github link to download the source code.
The IPs include:

Standard convolution IPs
Depth-wise seperatable convolution IPs
Pooling IPs
Bounding box regression IP
Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network IP

The IPs are developed in C/C++. The source code are synthesizable through Xilinx Vivado High Level Synthesis (VivadoHLS), and Register Transfer Level (RTL) code can be generated conveniently using VivadoHLS.

The source code for the above mentioned IPs can be found in the github:

https://github.com/DNN-Accelerators/Open-Source-IPs

This project is sponsored by Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) through a collaborative research project between University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and Cornell University. The IP developed by Cornell university can be found in the GitHub:
