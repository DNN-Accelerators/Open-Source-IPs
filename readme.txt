This IP Package includes an open-source IP repository specifically designed for machine learning applications. 

The IPs include:

Standard convolution IPs
Depth-wise seperatable convolution IPs
Pooling IPs
Bounding box regression IP
Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network IP

Each IP is provided with: introduction, interface description, inputs and outputs description, parameter configuration, and resource and performance. The IPs are developed in C/C++. The source code is synthesizable through Xilinx Vivado  High Level Synthesis (Vivado HLS), and Register Transfer Level (RTL) code can be generated conveniently using Vivado HLS.

This project is sponsored by Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) through a collaborative research project between University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Cornell University. The IPs developed by Cornell university can be found in the following GitHub:
